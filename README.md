# Parents Anniversary — Angular scaffold

This is a scaffolded Angular application celebrating 22 years together.

Quick start

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve locally (uses local or global Angular CLI)
# if you don't have a global ng, use npx
npx @angular/cli serve --open
# or
npm start
```

Replace images in `src/assets/images/` with your photos. I scaffolded components and a mock auth service (credentials: `parents` / `love22`). Let me know when you want me to add your photos and personalized timeline content.
